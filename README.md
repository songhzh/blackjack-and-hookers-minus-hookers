# Blackjacks and Hookers (minus hookers)

A classic card game that is fun for all ages. You can probably teach your dog to play this thing.

* Just run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`
* Instructions are on-screen
* Features:
  * A classic console feel. Be prepared to read a lot.
  * Automatic adder. Sometimes we just need a break from adding numbers.
  * DLC potential. Currently this is single-player-only.
  * Unicode characters. Did you think we were just going to use ascii? Think again, pal.
